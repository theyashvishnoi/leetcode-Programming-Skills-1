question - https://leetcode.com/problems/find-nearest-point-that-has-the-same-x-or-y-coordinate/

c++ code - 


// Explanation:
// (i)   we assign a variable answer with value of -1 as it would be return if no distance is found
// (ii)  we assign distance variable with max value an integer can store so that for the first time it would be greater the distance and line  11 would work and so on
// (iii) we check id ordinate or co-ordinate matches with on standing array, if so..
// (iv)  we check distance with dist variable, if dist is less than previously stored we will update the value of dist
// (v)   we store the index of that array to our answer as we have to return the index of array itself
// (vi)   repeat until end of array
// (vii)  in the end we return index as stored in answer

// Time: O(n)
// Space: O(1)
